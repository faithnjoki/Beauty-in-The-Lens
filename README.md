## Project setup instructions

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

```
Editor
Git
Github account
Python Language
Django framework
PostgreSQL
```

### Installing

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Here is a series of steps on how to set up the project on your local machine.

Click  https://github.com/faithnjoki/The-Beauty-in-the-Lens  to navigate on the main page of the project repository on Github.

```
Clone the repository using HTTPS, click "Clone with HTTPS".
```

```
Open Terminal. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
```

```
Type https://github.com/faithnjoki/The-Beauty-in-the-Lens and press Enter to create your local clone.

```

```
Open Photofolio, the cloned Repo in terminal and run : pip install -r requirements.txt to install the app dependencies

```

```
Run source virtual/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment and python manage.py runserver to launch the app

```

## BDD

As a user, I would like to:
-  search for image using their allocated categories
-  see a larger version of image and image details when i click on a single image
-  copy image link to machine clipboard
-  see images filtered by location

As an Admin, i would like to:
- see a dashboard that will be used to post photos to the database and manage the photos.
